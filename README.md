# **Mystic Empyrean Traits**
This is a simple tool to search through traits for the game Mystic Empyrean, by Level99 Games.
This is an unofficial project, with the blessings of Level99, but not supported by them.
## Installation
You will need python 3.x to run this tool (in future, binaries will be provided). Install python and pillow, and then run personalitytraits.py using your python3 interpreter.
Running the python script directly, with ./personalitytraits.py, may or may not work depending on your system.
